# FF14-TT-Simulator
A private little tool to simulate card games in FF14, to predict which moves lead to victory, and which to failure.

Currently the web application is being developed under this URL adress, on a section of my private website:
http://farelforever.com/tripletriad/

Open for critique or suggestions.
